An open source 6DOF aerospace flight simulator
This simulator integrates the equation's of motion for a small-to-medium sized sounding rocket. 
Supports variable thrust, mass, and inertia.
Allows for visualization of flight through Flight Gear
Simulates aeroheating for high speed flights
Aerodynamic modeling is done with Digital Datcom
